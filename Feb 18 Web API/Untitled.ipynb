    "RESTful services, also known as as RESTful APIs, are web services that follow the REST \n",

    "\n",
    "RESTful services are based on the following principles:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are seprated, allowing them to evolve \n",
    "independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stateless: Each request sent to the server contains all the information needed to complete\n",
    "the request. The server does not maintain any client context between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cacheable: Response from the server can be cached to improve performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Uniform interface: RESTful services use a uniform interface consisting of resources, HTTP \n",
    "verbs(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and hypermedia links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layered Systems: RESTful services can be composed of multiple layers, allowing for scalability,\n",
    "    flexibilty and security"
